          <h1>
            Physical activity helps distract the mind from life's stresses, which helps avoid negative thoughts.
     Exercise also helps reduce stress hormones <br>in the body and stimulates the production of endorphins, which are natural mood enhancers that keep depression and stress away from people.<br>
      It also helps increase the feeling of optimism and relaxation after a hard day, and it is worth noting that the relationship between exercise and <br>depression still needs many studies to prove.

          <p>Reducing the risk of contracting some diseases</p>
          <h1>Health experts assume that physical activity may reduce the risk of stroke and heart disease by about 10%. 
            Reducing the risk of developing type 2<br> diabetes by about 30-40%, and exercising helps maintain the health of the bodyâ€™s organs.
            Preventing high blood pressure, high cholesterol,<br> osteoporosis, and arthritis.</h1>

            <p>Providing the body with energy</p>
            <h1>Exercising for thirty minutes in the morning helps change the whole day;
              The release of endorphins into the bloodstream during exercise leads to a <br>feeling  of having more energy for the rest of the day.
              According to Todd Astorino, assistant professor of kinesiology at California State University,<br> San Marcos, enhancing body strength and endurance makes it easier to complete daily tasks.</h1>
